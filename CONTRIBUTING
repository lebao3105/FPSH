# Contributing to FPSH

Welcome! Welcome!

FPSH is in a very early state, that means it's not ready for production use yet. You know that. We all know that.

That's why you're here, no?

## Requirements

* Know how to use Git and Git services (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket..)

* Know about Pascal. The main language here.

* [Optional] Know about C/C++ (we may need it)

* [Optional] Know about build system. Here we just use Make.

* If you want to work on FPSH's scripting language, so learn about that too. Crafting Interpreters book will be your friend :-).

* Know about GNU Readline - library used for console usage.

* Want to package FPSH for other UNIX? Love it!
