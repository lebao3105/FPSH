## FPSH Language

Currently it's made based on Lox language's guide (CraftingInterpreters).

Not completed, especially scanner logic.

## Notes

* Strings in Pascal are null-termined (except ShortString which is not used with `{$H+}`). [Here.](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Character_and_string_types)

## TODOs

* Add `interactive` compiler definiton

* Enumerate each character of each line of the target string

* Proper error handling
